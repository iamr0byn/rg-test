The idea of humans participating in an alien hybrid program sounds absurd until you talk to people who have experienced it. Thousands of women and men around the world have had reproductive experiments carried out against their will. The most harrowing? Unexplained pregnancies that terminate without explanation. In many cases, the memories of what happened remain suppressed and fragmented, leaving experiencers confused, depressed and with a profound sense of loss. In others, the memories are visceral and emotionally disturbing. Thanks to increased public acceptance and regression therapy, more and more people are coming forward with stories of abductions and strange fertilization procedures that occur during their frightening experiences. Are aliens involved in a complex hybridization project where human females are used as vessels to carry hybrid fetuses and human males have their sperm harvested until they're ready to be transferred \"elsewhere?\" And if so, to what end? \"Extraordinary: The Seeding\" is a riveting documentary that tells these stories through one-on-one interviews with abductees-brave individuals willing to share intensely personal and emotional stories with the rest of the world. Through analysis with global ufology experts, the film also explores hybridization, why it's happening and what the impact on humanity is and will be. The information presented is intended to educate, entertain and encourage audiences to ask one simple question: What if this is all true?","movie_cast":["Richard Dolan","Alejandro Rojas","Chase Kloetzke","Barbara Lamb"],"language":"en","popularity":42.6786994934082,"classification":"","genres":["Documentary"],"tags":["alien"],"released_on":"2019-09-03","reelgood_url":"https://reelgood.com/movie/extraordinary-the-seeding-2019","trailer_url":["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb2SqglvKWk"],"production_company":["j3FILMS"],"runtime":"105"}

{"movie_id":"0780a96c-545b-4d9c-a194-9cc25f7b03b1","title":"Unacknowledged","overview":"\"Unacknowledged\" focuses on the historic files of the Disclosure Project and how UFO secrecy has been ruthlessly enforced-and why. The best evidence for extraterrestrial contact, dating back decades, is presented with direct top-secret witness testimony, documents and UFO footage, 80% of which has never been revealed anywhere else. The behind-the-scenes research and high-level meetings convened by Dr. Steven Greer will expose the degree of illegal, covert operations at the core of UFO secrecy. From briefings with the CIA Director, top Pentagon Generals and Admirals, to the briefing of President Obama via senior advisor John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton Campaign, we take the viewer behind the veil of secrecy and into the corridors of real power where the UFO secrets reside. The viewer will learn that a silent coup d'état has occurred dating back to the 1950s and that the Congress, the President and other world leaders have been sidelined by criminal elements within the military-industrial-financial complex.","movie_cast":["Giancarlo Esposito","Steven M.

Ian Montes is a picture of success. Despite being a son of a shipping tycoon, Ian refused to just coast on his father's empire; he built his own real-estate company and earned his first million at a very young age. He never looked back since then. Driven by his ambition to become better than, if not as good as his father, Ian managed to make it on his own. But behind all the glory is a man yearning for love and recognition. Wounded from his mother's abandonment when he was 17 and desperate for his father's approval, Ian longed for someone who could and would love him unconditionally. He felt this twice when he met two particular women: Joanna and Karyn. Joanna Villanueva is a picture of quiet confidence and success. Healing from heartbreak caused by an errant ex-husband, Joanna found love again when she rescued Ian from a water-skiing accident in La Union. Being a doctor, Joanna nurtured Ian and showered him with love and attention. With Joanna, Ian found the home he sorely missed and a life of bliss he never thought he could have. But there is also Karyn Torres, a flight attendant he met en route to Macau for a business trip. At 24, Karyn is the epitome of youthful sensuality and worldliness. With Karyn, every moment is filled with excitement and spontaneity. With Karyn, Ian found the life he's always wanted. So he's left with a choice. In the end, Ian, Joanna, and Karyn learn--painfully--the true meaning of unconditional love and forgiveness.","movie_cast":["Gerald Madrid","Baron Geisler","Gilleth Sandico","Bobby Andrews","TJ Trinidad","Angelica Panganiban","Maricel Soriano","Bart Guingona","Mark Acueza","Liza Diño","Aga Muhlach","Anita Linda","John Arcilla","Chin Chin Gutierrez","Dante Rivero","R.S.

Kenworthy’s footage of a battle between a tarantula and a wasp intrigued Disney, who funded a feature-length production following the lives of diverse desert species.

And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric \"Hoovey\" Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They're down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy's ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey's young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff's firefighting salary isn't enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey's teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...","movie_cast":["Glenn Morshower","Tom Costello Jr.","Melanie Morrow","Cody Linley","Charles Robinson","Stephen Baldwin","Jim Wise","Chad Gundersen","Belmarie Huynh","Hernando Planells Jr.","Jordan Farris","Elise Baughman","Patrick Warburton","Brandon Mychal Smith","Lauren Holly","Jeffry Elliott","Sean McNamara","Andrew Sensenig","Seth Lee","Christopher Morrow","Alyson Stoner","Alexandria DeBerry"],"language":"en","popularity":38.8894996643066,"classification":"7+","genres":["Drama","Family"],"tags":null,"released_on":"2015-01-31","reelgood_url":"https://reelgood.com/movie/hoovey-2015","trailer_url":null,"production_company":["EchoLight Studios","Gundersen Entertainment"],"runtime":"91"}

{"movie_id":"8c7090d6-12a4-4141-b0f2-45e93f2a68d0","title":"Nixon by Nixon: In His Own Words","overview":"On Aug. 9, 1974, Richard Milhous Nixon became the first American president to resign from office. From 1971 to 1973, he had secretly recorded his private conversations, purportedly for the purpose of historical record, but in the wake of the Watergate scandal the revelation of the tapes led to his downfall. Fearing that the blunt and candid remarks on the tapes would sully the presidency forever, Nixon sought to prevent their public release for the rest of his life after leaving office. However, after his death in 1994, the government began releasing the 3,700 hours of recordings. The final tapes were made public on Aug. 20, 2013. In 1982, John Ehrlichman, Nixons former chief domestic advisor, voiced concern about the Nixon tapes, noting, The problem is that historians are going to grab an hour of tapeand if you listen to a snippet of tape, youre going to form an impression of this man thats going to be wrong. Sometime, hopefully, there will be a committee of historians who will listen to all the tapes and go into all the archives and then come out and say Richard Nixon was the strangest collection, the strangest paradoxical combination of any man I ever heard of. And theyll be right. Only Chief of Staff H.R. Bob Haldeman, Deputy Assistant Alexander Butterfield and Special Assistant Stephen Bull knew of the recordings. Those who did not know included John Ehrlichman, National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, Deputy National Security Advisor Andrew Haig, Attorney General John Mitchell and Secretary of State William Rogers, among others. It was voice activated everything was taped which was probably stupid, Nixon conceded in 1983. The declassified tapes revealed the Presidents opinions on a vast number of topics, including the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers leak, his Supreme Court appointments, and other matters of state. Nixon derided anti-war protesters in private conversations with Henry Kissinger, saying, It really burns me up. We have no pride do we anymore, Henry? He had equally harsh words for young Vietnam vet John Kerry, calling him quite a phony. Years later, Nixon insisted that despite the anti-war sentiment in Congress and the media, That was not the voice of America. The voice of America was the silent majority. Nixons angry reaction to the New York Times publication of thousands of secret Pentagon documents detailing Americas involvement in Vietnam revealed his growing hatred of the press. This is treasonable action on the part of the bastards that put it out, he exclaimed to Henry Kissinger. Daniel Ellsberg of the Rand Corporation, who released the papers to the Times, became a target of his anti-Semitic outbursts. The Jews are, are born spies, he said, and asked Chief of Staff Haldeman to look at any sensitive areas around where Jews are involved. With two vacancies open on the Supreme Court and pressure mounting to nominate a woman, Nixon told the press his list of candidates included Mildred Lillie and Sylvia Bacon. But behind closed doors, he told John Mitchell, I would like to sorta get them off the woman kick if we can. Years later, Nixon called the appointment of the Supreme Court justices the most important achievement domestically of his presidency. Internationally, Nixon described his historic trip to China in 1972 as a watershed moment, and cited his trip to Moscow to negotiate an arms control agreement, as another major foreign policy achievement. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy, Nixon can be heard telling Henry Kissinger. You must keep up the attack on the media. Youve got to keep destroying their credibility, he told Special Counsel Charles Colson. Whether calling them sons of bitches or bastards, Nixons distaste of reporters was only thinly veiled in interviews, and entirely open behind closed doors. After the Watergate break-in, Nixon discussed with Bob Haldeman bailing out the five men arrested saying, Well, they took a hell of a risk. And they have to be paid. Later, he told speechwriter Pat Buchanan, The Watergate thing well, thats going to pass. Thatll be over. Theyll indict a few people, and then the goddam things over. Despite Nixons reelection landslide victory and the achievement of what he called, peace with honor in Vietnam, Watergate did not pass. At the Senate Watergate hearing on July 16, 1973, former Deputy Assistant Alexander Butterfield revealed the secret electronic listening devices in the office of the president. Facing certain impeachment, Nixon subsequently resigned.","movie_cast":["John F. Kennedy","Daniel Ellsberg","Howard K. Smith","John Dean","Mao Zedong","Adele Rogers","J.

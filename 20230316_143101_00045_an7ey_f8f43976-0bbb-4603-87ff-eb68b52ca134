Nazo no Shoujo Apis","overview":"During the storm  a girl escaped from a Marine ship. The report was sent to Admiral Nelson Royale  who is very disappointed that the marines had made this mistake. And explained to them that the girl is the key to obtaining Ryuukotsu  the elixir of eternal life. His servant Erik was given a task to search and find the girl at all costs. It's been 2 days since the Straw Hat Pirates left Loguetown. Usopp spotted a flock of bird surrounding an object at sea. Sanji explained that normally birds would do that  when a school of fish are around. Luffy got excited and used his Gomu Gomu Net to reach out and grab what he thinks is a fish. But it turned out to be a girl who is all worn out. She woke up and accidentally hit Usopp in the chin  and found herself in the mess hall. Nami was glad that she came through  and told her that Sanji is preparing her some soup. The girl finds herself lucky to be saved. Nami asked for the girl's name  but she insists to know their names. So Nami introduced everyone  and right until she mentioned Luffy being captain of the pirate ship. The girl became scared and paralyzed. She didn't eat any of the meals that were offered and sat in a corner thinking that she's in for the worst. Her stomach moaned  so she crept to the mess hall to see what was in the fridge. Only to find a trap being set off. Sanji turn on the light and found the girl and Luffy(who was caught in a large mouse trap). The trap was set  for security measures on protecting the food from thievery  especially when Luffy is the only one on board who tries to steal a snack. Sanji prepared the girl some soup  but she didn't want any of it. Sanji told her that he's not trying to poison her. So she tried it  and found it to be delicious. The girl started to trust the Straw Hat Pirates more. The next morning  the girl tried to make breakfast. But it was all burnt with too much seasoning. Sanji cheered the girl up  that all cooks make mistakes in cooking. He told everyone to eat it all up to encourage her. They all learned that the girl's name is Apis. And she's been adrift on the life boat for 3 days. And escaped from a marine ship. And she wasn't on board it as a guest. As Zoro states that Marines don't take regulars on board like a cruise would. Luffy wondered why the Marines would take a girl like Apis. Apis didn't want to tell them why  so she told them where she's from: Gunkan Island. Located near the Grand Line  and has the silhouette of a battle ship. Since Apis's home island is close to their destination  the Straw Hat Pirates will gladly help Apis get home. Meanwhile a fleet of Marine ships has spotted the Going Merry. The recognized it as a pirate ship because of their jolly roger of the straw skull. The Major of the ship  found the ship's appearance to be weak  so they'll ignore them. But Erik(who is also on board)told the Major that the jolly roger of that ship belongs to the Straw Hat Pirates lead by Monkey D. Luffy  the 30 000 000 Belli bounty head pirate. And for that Erik finds ignoring a wanted pirate to be unwise-able. And insists they seize the ship. Usopp(who's taking watch on the crow nest) saw the Marine fleet coming their way. Apis recognize the division as the one she escaped from. Luffy and the crew learned that fleet is after Apis. A marine spotted Apis with his binoculars  and told the Major that the Going Merry has Apis on board. Erik was pleased to found out that Apis is with the Straw Hat Pirates. And told Major  on how upset Admiral Nelson would of been if he'd ignore the Going Merry without knowing that Apis was on board. The Major got scared for thinking about what would of happened. He orders his men to fire the cannons. The cannons missed  and Major used his megaphone to tell the Going Merry that was only a warning shot  while the next one will hit them. Zoro and Luffy plan to fight off the fleet  while Usopp finds that to be crazy. Apis on the other hand noticed that all the seagulls are parched on ship. And knows that a gust of wind is about to come. So Nami told Zoro to face the sails south. Then the gust of wind came by and gave them a jump start towards south. Leaving the marines behind who are too slow to catch up. Erik finds it pathetic for a small ship to get away from a whole fleet. One of the Marines told the Major that the Going Merry is headed to the one place that is dangerous. So Major ordered the whole fleet to halt and reverse course. Erik wanted to know why the Major would stop the ships from pursuing the Straw Hat Pirates. The Major mentions that if they continued to proceed  they'll get trapped at the Calm Belt. Erik remained Major that if they don't rescue Apis  Major will have to face the consequences from Admiral Nelson. The Major however didn't care what his punishment will be. And won't risk his men to be harmed. Usopp and Luffy cheered that they got away from the Marines in sheer luck. Nami noticed Zoro looking serious and wanted to know why.

Apis and Luffy hurried to take it off his head  but Ryuuji visioned the flying fish as his species. And Apis heard Ryuuji saying that Lost Island is located to the East. So they head east now that they know where to go. Erik got word from the marines that the Going Merry has changed course. So Major ordered the whole fleet to go east as well. Luffy sat on the front end of the Going Merry wondering what Lost Island is like. Usopp and Nami took watch on top of the crow's nest  while Apis accompanied Ryuuji till they make it to the island. Luffy saw what appeared to be a smoking image. And when they got closer it was the shape of a ship  Luffy touched it which became a reflection of the Going Merry. They were all amazed that they're entering an invisible barrier. The Marine fleet was terrified to see the Going Merry disappeared. Major ordered the whole fleet to stop until they confirm about what they've seen. Again Erik finds the Major's attitude to be cowardly and insists on using a lifeboat for him to go after the Straw Hat Pirates alone  since the marines are too afraid to face danger. After going through the barrier  Nami explain it was a mirage that can be created when warm and cold water are mixed. Then they entered a storm all of a sudden. Apis tries to keep Ryuuji calm till they get through the storm. But right till the rope to the cart started to loosen up. Apis got hold of the rope  and Zoro came to help her pull the rope back. Then Luffy used his stretched arm to support the cart. They eventually got out of the storm  which is like a defense wall surrounding the island. And they finally made it to lost island  which is filled with ruins and jungles. Apis tried to wake up Ryuuji  who's still laying on the cart doing nothing. Apis has a feeling that they're not on Lost Island. But they don't think so  unless they explore the island to know so. So they proceed towards the summit of the island. On their way  the Straw Hat Pirates discovered a town in ruins. Telling them that there was once a civilization here on the island. When they finally made it to the top  it appeared to be the entrance to Dragon's Nest. Only problem is there is no door of any kind. Apis however noticed a missing claw on the drawing of the dragon  and believes that the dragon claw that Ryuuji gave her will open it. She was about to put it in  but discovers that she can't reach. So Luffy does the honor of opening the entrance. Before he touched the claw slot  the whole ground shook and they all fell down as it collapsed. They were all OK  and finds themselves inside what they believe to be is Dragon's Nest. Now they must explore the mysterious temple of the millennium dragons. Will they find Ryuuji's species? And what will they do when Erik comes to try to cause trouble?","released_on":"2001-02-07T12:00:00Z"}

And those invited to the funeral  including his lady companion Luisa Montero  are crying on the sisters and Carlos' shoulders. Finally  Martinez tells them the sign: a big white bird flying around overhead. Martinez' sign was Sister Bertrille in flight.

However Sister Bertrille decides to actually take off in flight right in front of him. It's then that he believes he has not seen The Sign and is going to live.

It's Valentine's week  and their temptation challenge is something they may face on Valentine's: cupcakes and other such baked goods. Without being able to see what the others are doing  the person who consumes the most calories in ten minutes wins a two pound advantage at this week's weigh-in  with the winner also giving a two pound advantage to another contestant. Jillian in particular chastises those who consumed any food for \"playing the game\". The week's reward challenge is a multi-round race  with the losing contestant in each round eliminated until one contestant remains standing. The winner receives a one-day visit from a loved one at the ranch. The outcome of the challenge takes an unexpected turn. At the workouts  the trainers have breakthroughs with some of the contestants. At the post weigh-in vote  the eliminated contestant voices displeasure not at being eliminated  but at how the vote went down. Meanwhile  the trainers encourage their child obesity ambassador to partake in an activity they've always wanted to do. In addition  Biingo waits to hear whether his cast can be removed.","released_on":"2013-02-11T12:00:00Z"}

This scenario places extra pressure on every single person as the potential one from their team whose weight will count. As such  both Bob and Jillian work their respective team harder than usual  with neither tolerating fits of \"drama\" as some contestants are apt to do when they don't want to work hard. Their pop challenge involves cooking with chefs Curtis Stone and Lorena Garcia  where three from each team will  with the assistance of one of the chefs  prepare a dish apiece for the remaining six to judge  with the team with the highest overall judged dishes winning a mysterious advantage at the upcoming team challenge. The catches are that the others won't know who cooked what  and neither Chef Curtis or Chef Lorena are allowed to touch the food during its preparation. When the teams learn of the team challenge  they understand the importance of the mysterious \"10 second advantage\" that Alison mentioned as the pop challenge reward  and learn the importance of the reward with relation to the week's weigh-in. Each team realizes that the obvious choices for the weigh-in are Elizabeth and Jessica based on historically being near the bottom of every weigh-in thus far. Will either team surprise by choosing someone else?","released_on":"2010-10-26T12:00:00Z"}

She explains the idea of point of view and assigns everyone a project to demonstrate their point of view to the class. Tutter struggles with the assignment --- as far as he's concerned  he sees things from a \"boring old Tutter point of view \" and not any differently than anyone else. After hearing about the assignment  Treelo paints some paintings to show his point of view. Meanwhile  Tutter finds a camera his Grandma Flutter gave him and decides to make a film called Mouse on Mars --- but not only does he not know much about Mars  it doesn't really represent his point of view. He joins Bear in listening to a Shadow story about the point of view of a duck and a ladybug. Afterwards  Treelo's paintings provide inspiration.   Songs   It All Depends Upon Your Point of View   Notes   This is the first of a set of eight episodes shown from April 24-28  2006. These episodes were produced for the fourth season  but didn't air on Disney Channel until 2006  well over two years after new episodes of the show originally stopped airing. It was long rumored that these episodes might eventually appear  as there were gaps in the known production numbers. These episodes have previously appeared in some foreign markets.   Allusions   Tutter's film-title  Mouse on Mars  shares its name with a popular band from Germany known for electronic music.","released_on":"2003-10-20T12:00:00Z"}
